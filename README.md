# KinldeConvert
1,KinldeConvert is a tool for Kindle-using

    It helps people convert file to mobi format,
    so he or she can send it to Kindle by sending an attachment to Amazon kindle address,
    so he or she can use the function of book sync of Amazon.

2,This tool is based on KindleUnpack and KindleGen,i just put all these functions together.
    
    I will add more functions depend on my own need.
    Functions that most people are using also will be supported.
    Graphic UI for both MS-Windows and MAC is also under considered.
    For now,its just a linux shell script,you may need some computer skills.
    According to support cross platform, i will rewrite it with Python.
