# KinldeConvert
1,KinldeConvert is a tool for Kindle-using

    It helps people convert file to mobi format, so he or she can send it to Kindle by sending an attachment to Amazon kindle address,so he or she can use the function of book sync of Amazon.

2,This tool is based on KindleUnpack and KindleGen

   I will add more functions depend on my own need,which is sure.
   If i have time,functions that most people are using will be added,of cause all of them are based on KindleUnpack and KindleGen.
   Graphic UI might be added for both MS-Windows and MAC.
   For now,its just a linux shell script,you may need some computer skills.
   According to support cross platform, python script is in considered.
